ssoCard and datacloud
=====================

.. _out-of-date:

Updating out-of-date ssoCards
-----------------------------

The ``$ rocks status`` command echos the number of locally cached ssoCards and checks their version against the current SsODNet global ssoCard version. If any ssoCard is out-of-date, ``rocks`` offers to retrieve the latest versions of these cards.
